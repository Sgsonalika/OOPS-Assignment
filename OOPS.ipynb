        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, protecting the integrity of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Feature: Access control is achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",

        "            self.__age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It simplifies the interaction with objects by exposing only essential information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Feature: Abstract classes and interfaces can be used to achieve abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent class). It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Feature: Single, multiple (in some languages), or multi-level inheritance.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. Polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even though their actual behavior might be defined in the child class. It enables the same method to behave differently depending on the object calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Feature: Method overriding and method overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",

        "\n",
        "Definition: Dynamic dispatch is a mechanism where the method that is executed is determined at runtime, based on the object instance. It supports late binding in OOP languages, ensuring the most derived method is called.\n",

        "Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "MRO is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes when a method is called on an object. This is especially important in the case of multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. Python follows a specific order to determine which method or attribute to use, ensuring that it resolves method conflicts in a predictable manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "The MRO is determined using the C3 linearization algorithm, which establishes a consistent order in which methods from base classes are called. It ensures that every class in the inheritance chain appears only once and respects the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "How MRO Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "In case of multiple inheritance, Python first looks at the method in the current class. If it doesn't find the method there, it looks in the parent classes in the order defined by the MRO. The MRO ensures that the method is called in the right order without conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Retrieving MRO Programmatically:\n",
        "You can retrieve the MRO of a class using the mro() method or by accessing the __mro__ attribute. Both will give you the method resolution order of the class.\n",
